# Ayurv - Project Context

## What This Is
A safety-first Ayurvedic intelligence database for an Indian healthcare AI assistant.
NOT a prescription engine. NOT marketing content. NOT spiritual writing.

## Core Principles
- Structured, evidence-graded (A/B/C/D), risk-coded (🟢🟡🔴)
- Clinically sober, legally safe, Indian-context aware
- Classical Ayurveda + modern pharmacology cross-reference
- No cure claims, no miracle language, no vague "balances energy"

## Framework v2 (High-Authority Mode) — Mandatory Structure
1. **Overview** — Classical references, traditional indications, honest positioning
2. **Ayurvedic Perspective** — Rasa/Guna/Virya/Vipaka/Dosha, aggravation scenarios
3. **Modern Pharmacology** — Key compounds, mechanistic actions, evidence table (A/B/C/D grading)
4. **Safe Usage Ranges** — Form-specific doses, duration, timing, hydration, disclaimer
5. **Risk Coding** — 🟢🟡🔴 with WHY explanation for each condition
6. **Side Effects** — Tiered: Common / Uncommon / Rare
7. **Drug Interactions** — Structured table with risk level and mechanism
8. **Misuse Patterns in India** — Real-world overconsumption, marketing abuse, self-medication dangers
9. **Special Sections** (herb-specific) — Religious sensitivity, cognitive hype control, botanical clarification, etc.
10. **When to See a Doctor** — Clear escalation triggers

## Evidence Grading System
- **A** = Multiple human RCTs or meta-analysis (robust)
- **B** = Small clinical trials with positive results (promising)
- **C** = Animal studies, in-vitro, or observational data
- **D** = Traditional use only, no modern clinical validation

## Hard Safety Rules
- Never claim cure. Never say "100% safe."
- Never give disease-specific treatment protocols.
- If evidence limited → clearly state that.
- Serious illness → general understanding + strongly suggest qualified practitioner.
- Pregnant/chronic disease → always emphasize medical consultation.
- Red flags → immediate medical care redirect.

## Consultancy Mode
- Structured follow-up questions (age, conditions, medications, duration, severity, pregnancy status)
- General Ayurvedic pattern analysis, lifestyle/diet suggestions, gentle herb examples
- Strong safety boundaries always

## Tone
- Professional, Indian healthcare-aware, calm, responsible, confident
- Not mystical, not devotional, not dismissive, not preachy

## Current State
