## 1. Overview

Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, classified as a **Rasayana** (rejuvenative tonic). The name literally means "smell of horse" — referring both to the herb's distinct smell and the traditional belief that it imparts the strength and vitality of a horse.

It has been used for over 3,000 years in Indian traditional medicine, primarily as an adaptogenic, strengthening, and calming herb. It occupies a central place in Ayurvedic formulations for debility, stress, nervous exhaustion, and general weakness.

Charaka Samhita classifies it under **Balya** (strength-promoting) and **Brimhaniya** (mass-building) groups.

## 2. Ayurvedic Perspective

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Rasa** (Taste) | Tikta (Bitter), Kashaya (Astringent), Madhura (Sweet) |
| **Guna** (Qualities) | Laghu (Light), Snigdha (Unctuous) |
| **Virya** (Potency) | Ushna (Heating) |
| **Vipaka** (Post-digestive effect) | Madhura (Sweet) |
| **Prabhava** (Special action) | Rasayana (Rejuvenative) |

### Dosha Impact
- **Vata:** Pacifies strongly (Ushna virya + Snigdha guna + Madhura vipaka — ideal Vata combination)
- **Kapha:** Pacifies moderately (Tikta rasa + Laghu guna counteract Kapha, though Snigdha guna may mildly aggravate in excess)
- **Pitta:** Use with caution in Pitta-dominant individuals or Pitta-aggravated conditions due to Ushna virya. Often combined with cooling herbs (like Shatavari) to offset this.

### Traditional Indications (Ayurvedic)
- Daurbalya (General debility)
- Kshaya (Wasting/emaciation)
- Nidranasha (Insomnia)
- Vatavyadhi (Vata disorders — joint pain, tremors, nervous conditions)
- Shukra kshaya (Low reproductive vitality)
- Rasayana (Anti-aging, longevity)

## 3. Modern Understanding

### Active Compounds
- **Withanolides** (Withaferin A, Withanolide D) — primary bioactive group
- **Withanosides** (glycosylated withanolides)
- **Sitoindosides** (VII, VIII, IX, X)
- Alkaloids (Somniferine, Withanine — minor)
- Steroidal lactones
- Iron content (notable in root)

### Evidence Level: **Moderate to Strong** (for specific claims)

| Claim | Evidence Level | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Stress/cortisol reduction | **Strong** | Multiple RCTs. Significant cortisol reduction (14-28%) in controlled studies. |
| Anxiety reduction | **Strong** | Several double-blind RCTs. Comparable to some anxiolytics in specific trials. |
| Sleep quality improvement | **Moderate** | Clinically meaningful improvement in insomnia scores (multiple RCTs). Active compound: Triethylene glycol (from leaves). |
| Muscle strength/recovery | **Moderate** | Improved VO2 max, muscle strength, and recovery in several trials. |
| Testosterone/male fertility | **Moderate** | Increased sperm count, motility, and serum testosterone in infertile men (multiple studies). Less clear in healthy males. |
| Cognitive function | **Moderate** | Improvements in reaction time, task performance, memory in some RCTs. |
| Blood sugar reduction | **Limited-Moderate** | Some positive results, but inconsistent across studies. |
| Anti-inflammatory | **Limited-Moderate** | In-vitro and animal studies strong. Human clinical data still building. |
| Thyroid modulation | **Limited** | May increase T3/T4 levels. Clinically relevant for hypothyroid tendencies. Caution in hyperthyroid. |
| Anti-cancer | **Limited** | Withaferin A shows promise in-vitro. No human clinical evidence for cancer treatment. |

### Known Pharmacological Actions
- HPA axis modulation (cortisol regulation)
- GABAergic activity (anxiolytic, sleep)
- Anti-inflammatory (NF-kB pathway inhibition)
- Immunomodulatory (enhances NK cell activity)
- Antioxidant (free radical scavenging)
- Mild thyroid-stimulating effect

## 4. Suggested Safe Usage Range

> **"This is general educational information, not a medical prescription. Dosage depends on individual constitution, health status, and formulation. Consult a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner or healthcare provider before use."**

### General Adult Educational Range

| Form | Typical Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Root powder (Churna)** | 3–6 g/day | Traditionally taken with warm milk, ghee, or honey. Divided into 2 doses. |
| **Standardized extract** (2.5-5% withanolides) | 300–600 mg/day | Most studied form in clinical trials. Usually divided into 2 doses. |
| **KSM-66** (root-only extract) | 300–600 mg/day | Full-spectrum root extract. Well-studied. |
| **Sensoril** (root + leaf extract) | 125–250 mg/day | Higher withanolide concentration per mg. Lower dose needed. |
| **Decoction (Kwath)** | 50–100 ml/day | Traditional preparation. Less standardized. |
| **Ashwagandha Ghrita** | As per practitioner | Classical ghee-based preparation. |
| **Ashwagandhadi Lehya** | As per practitioner | Classical confection preparation. |

### Duration Considerations
- Most clinical trials: 8–12 weeks.
- Traditional Ayurveda often uses it cyclically (e.g., 2-3 months on, 1 month off), though this varies by practitioner.
- Long-term continuous use (>6 months) — limited safety data from clinical trials. Not necessarily harmful, but periodic practitioner review is sensible.
- Effects on stress/sleep may be noticed within 2–4 weeks. Strength/vitality effects typically take 6–8 weeks.

### Best Taken
- **For sleep:** At night with warm milk (traditional Ksheerapaka method).
- **For energy/vitality:** Morning with breakfast.
- **For stress/anxiety:** Divided doses, morning and night.
- **With food** — generally better tolerated (reduces GI discomfort).

## 5. Who Should Avoid / Use Caution

| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Pregnancy** | **AVOID.** Traditional Ayurvedic texts classify it as Garbhashaya Shuddikara (uterine stimulant action noted). Insufficient safety data. Some animal studies suggest teratogenic potential at high doses. |
| **Lactation** | **Insufficient data.** Traditionally used post-partum in some formulations, but no modern safety data for breastfeeding. Consult practitioner. |
| **Hyperthyroidism / Graves' Disease** | **AVOID or use extreme caution.** May increase thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4). Can worsen hyperthyroid conditions. |
| **Hypothyroidism (on medication)** | **Caution.** May potentiate thyroid medication. Thyroid levels should be monitored. Dose adjustment may be needed. |
| **Autoimmune conditions** (Lupus, RA, MS, Hashimoto's) | **Caution.** Immunomodulatory effects could theoretically stimulate an already overactive immune response. Evidence is mixed — some practitioners use it, but conservative approach is to avoid without supervision. |
| **Hypertension (on medication)** | **Caution.** May have mild hypotensive effects. Could potentiate BP-lowering drugs. |
| **Diabetes (on medication)** | **Caution.** May lower blood sugar. Risk of hypoglycemia if combined with antidiabetic drugs. Monitor glucose. |
| **Scheduled surgery** | **Discontinue 2 weeks before.** Due to potential effects on anaesthesia, blood sugar, blood pressure, and immune modulation. |
| **Liver conditions** | **Caution.** Rare reports of liver injury (see Side Effects). Periodic liver function monitoring if using long-term. |
| **Children** | **Limited data.** Some Ayurvedic paediatric formulations include it at lower doses, but modern safety data for children is insufficient. Practitioner guidance essential. |
| **Solanaceae (nightshade) allergy** | **Avoid.** Ashwagandha belongs to the Solanaceae family. |
| **Iron overload / Hemochromatosis** | **Caution.** Root contains iron. |

## 6. Possible Side Effects

**Common (dose-dependent, generally mild):**
- Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset) — especially on empty stomach or at higher doses
- Drowsiness / sedation (especially at higher doses or with nighttime use)

**Uncommon:**
- Headache
- Skin rash (allergic reaction, rare)
- Increased appetite
- Vivid dreams

**Rare but Reported:**
- **Hepatotoxicity** — Multiple case reports in medical literature (2020–2024) of liver injury associated with Ashwagandha supplements, including some requiring hospitalization. Mechanism unclear. Risk factors may include higher doses, prolonged use, or individual susceptibility. The Iceland/Sweden DILI registry has flagged it.
- Thyroid overstimulation symptoms (palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance) in susceptible individuals
- Vertigo (rare)

**Important Note:** Most side effects are reported with extract forms (higher withanolide concentration). Traditional whole-root preparations at moderate doses have a long history of use with fewer reported issues, but this does not guarantee safety for every individual.

## 7. Drug Interactions (Known and Theoretical)

| Drug/Class | Interaction | Severity |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Thyroid hormones** (Levothyroxine) | May increase T3/T4 levels. Potentiation risk. | **Moderate-High** |
| **Sedatives / Benzodiazepines** | Additive sedation (GABAergic activity). | **Moderate** |
| **Antidiabetic drugs** (Metformin, Glimepiride, Insulin) | Additive blood sugar lowering. Hypoglycemia risk. | **Moderate** |
| **Antihypertensives** | Additive blood pressure lowering. | **Low-Moderate** |
| **Immunosuppressants** (Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus, etc.) | May counteract immunosuppression due to immune-stimulating effects. | **Moderate-High** |
| **Blood thinners** (Warfarin, Aspirin) | Theoretical interaction. Limited data. Use caution. | **Low-Moderate** |
| **CYP450 substrates** | Some in-vitro evidence of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 modulation. Clinical significance uncertain. | **Low (theoretical)** |
| **Alcohol** | Additive sedation and CNS depression. | **Moderate** |
| **Other adaptogens/herbs** | Generally combined safely in traditional practice, but additive effects possible. | **Low** |
