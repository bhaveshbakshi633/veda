## 1. Overview

Yashtimadhu is one of the most widely used herbs in global traditional medicine systems — Ayurveda, TCM (Gan Cao), Unani (Asl-us-soos), and Western herbalism. It is also, critically, one of the most pharmacologically potent and potentially dangerous herbs in common use. The compound glycyrrhizin, responsible for its characteristic sweetness (50x sweeter than sugar), has a well-characterised mechanism of toxicity that can cause life-threatening hypertension, hypokalemia, and cardiac arrhythmia. This herb demands more pharmacological respect than it typically receives.

### Classical References

- **Charaka Samhita** — One of the most frequently cited herbs across all Sthanas. Classified under **Sandhaniya** (fracture healing), **Varnya** (complexion enhancing), **Kanthya** (throat-soothing), **Kandughna** (anti-pruritic), **Shukra Janana** (reproductive tissue promoting), **Snehopaga** (adjunct to oleation therapy), **Vamanopaga** (adjunct to emesis therapy), **Jivaniya** (vitalising), **Mutravirajaniya** (urine-purifying). It is one of the herbs that appears in the most number of Charaka's drug groups — reflecting its versatility as a "harmoniser" in formulations.
- **Sushruta Samhita** — Referenced for Netra Roga (eye conditions), Vrana Ropana (wound healing), and as a Rasayana.
- **Ashtanga Hridaya** — Described for Amlapitta (hyperacidity), Kasa (cough), and as a Medhya adjunct.
- **Bhavaprakasha Nighantu** — Detailed monograph. Describes it as Medhya, Balya, Varnya, Keshya (hair-promoting), Chakshushya (eye-beneficial), and Vrishya (aphrodisiac).

### Medhya Rasayana Classification
Yashtimadhu is one of Charaka's **four Medhya Rasayanas** (along with Mandukaparni Swarasa, Guduchi Swarasa, and Shankhpushpi Kalka). The recommended form is Yashtimadhu Churna with milk — specifically for enhancing intellect and memory. This is sometimes overlooked because Yashtimadhu is more commonly associated with throat and GI use than cognitive function.

### Classical Role as Harmoniser
Yashtimadhu is called "the peacemaker of formulations" in some traditional commentaries. Its Madhura rasa and Sheeta virya moderate the harshness of heating, pungent, or irritating herbs in polyherbal preparations. It reduces GI irritation from other herbs, smooths the taste profile, and provides a balancing influence. This is why it appears in an extraordinary number of classical formulations — not always as the primary active herb, but as a support and harmoniser. This is pharmacologically analogous to how glycyrrhizin enhances bioavailability of other compounds (demonstrated for some drugs).

### What Makes This Herb Uniquely Dangerous
Unlike most herbs in this database where the risk profile involves mild GI effects, theoretical drug interactions, or low-level concerns, Yashtimadhu has a **well-characterised, dose-dependent, clinically documented toxicity mechanism** that has caused hospitalisations and deaths. The compound glycyrrhizin causes pseudohyperaldosteronism — a condition mimicking aldosterone excess, leading to sodium retention, potassium wasting, hypertension, oedema, and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia. This is not theoretical. It is textbook medicine.

## 2. Ayurvedic Perspective

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Rasa** (Taste) | Madhura (Sweet) — dominant and characteristic |
| **Guna** (Qualities) | Guru (Heavy), Snigdha (Unctuous) |
| **Virya** (Potency) | Sheeta (Cooling) |
| **Vipaka** (Post-digestive effect) | Madhura (Sweet) |

### Dosha Action
- **Pitta:** Strongly pacifies. Madhura rasa + Sheeta virya + Snigdha guna + Madhura vipaka — profoundly cooling and soothing. Primary Pitta herb along with Shatavari and Amalaki.
- **Vata:** Pacifies. Madhura rasa + Snigdha guna + Guru guna counter Vata's dryness, lightness, and coldness. The Sheeta virya is Vata-neutral-to-mild-aggravating, but the overall profile is Vata-soothing.
- **Kapha:** Aggravates with excess use. Madhura + Guru + Snigdha + Sheeta = the maximum Kapha-building profile possible. Chronic or high-dose use in Kapha-dominant individuals leads to water retention, weight gain, congestion, and sluggishness. This aligns precisely with the modern understanding of glycyrrhizin-induced fluid retention.

### The Ayurvedic-Pharmacological Alignment
Remarkably, the Ayurvedic description of Yashtimadhu's Kapha-aggravating effects (water retention, heaviness, oedema) maps almost perfectly onto the modern understanding of glycyrrhizin-induced pseudohyperaldosteronism (sodium/water retention, oedema, weight gain). Classical Ayurveda identified the clinical phenomenon centuries before the molecular mechanism was understood.

## 3. Modern Pharmacology

### Key Compounds

- **Glycyrrhizin (Glycyrrhizic acid)** — 2-14% of dry root weight. Triterpenoid saponin glycoside. 50x sweeter than sucrose. The primary bioactive AND the primary toxicity compound. Metabolised to **glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-glycyrrhetinic acid)** in the gut, which is the active metabolite.
- **Glycyrrhetinic acid (Enoxolone)** — The aglycone of glycyrrhizin. Inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) — the enzyme that inactivates cortisol in the kidney. THIS is the mechanism of toxicity.
- **Liquiritigenin** — Flavanone. Estrogenic activity (weak phytoestrogen). Anti-inflammatory.
- **Isoliquiritigenin** — Chalcone. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, potential anti-tumour (in-vitro).
- **Glabridin** — Isoflavane. Antioxidant, skin-lightening (tyrosinase inhibition), anti-atherogenic. Primary active in "deglycyrrhizinated" (DGL) preparations.
- **Liquiritin** — Flavonoid glycoside. Antidepressant-like effects in animal models.
- **Glycycoumarin** — Anti-hepatotoxic in animal models.

### The Toxicity Mechanism — Detailed

This must be understood because it is the foundation of all risk assessment for this herb.

**Normal physiology:**
- Cortisol and aldosterone both bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the kidney.
- The enzyme **11β-HSD2** converts cortisol to inactive cortisone in kidney tubular cells, preventing cortisol from activating the MR.
- This allows aldosterone (present at much lower concentrations) to selectively activate the MR, regulating sodium/potassium balance.

**Glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid effect:**
- Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits 11β-HSD2.
- Without this enzyme, cortisol (present at 100-1000x higher concentration than aldosterone) floods the MR.
- Result: **Pseudohyperaldosteronism** — the body acts as if there is massive aldosterone excess.
- Sodium retention → water retention → hypertension → oedema
- Potassium wasting → hypokalemia → muscle weakness → cardiac arrhythmia
- Metabolic alkalosis

**Dose-response:**
- **Toxicity threshold:** Approximately 100mg glycyrrhizin/day (equivalent to ~50g licorice root or ~2-3g concentrated extract) taken chronically. Some individuals are sensitive at lower doses.
- **Time course:** Effects develop over 1-4 weeks of daily use. Not acute single-dose toxicity.
- **Reversibility:** Usually reversible within 1-4 weeks of cessation, but severe cases (cardiac arrhythmia, extreme hypokalemia) can be life-threatening before reversal.
- **Individual variation:** Significant. Some individuals develop toxicity at modest doses; others tolerate higher amounts. Genetic variation in 11β-HSD2 activity, baseline aldosterone levels, and renal function all contribute.

### Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice (DGL)

**DGL** is licorice root extract with glycyrrhizin removed (>97% removal). It retains flavonoids (glabridin, liquiritigenin) and other non-glycyrrhizin compounds. DGL was developed specifically to provide licorice's GI-protective effects without the mineralocorticoid toxicity.

- DGL does NOT cause pseudohyperaldosteronism.
- DGL retains anti-ulcer and mucosal-protective effects (some evidence).
- DGL is NOT equivalent to whole licorice — it loses the anti-inflammatory potency of glycyrrhetinic acid.
- **For patients who need licorice's GI effects but are at risk for glycyrrhizin toxicity, DGL is the appropriate choice.**

### Evidence Table

| Claim | Evidence Level | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Peptic ulcer / Gastric mucosal protection | **B** | Multiple older clinical trials (Carbenoxolone — a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative — was an approved ulcer drug before PPIs). DGL shows mucosal protection in small trials. Mechanism: increased prostaglandin synthesis, mucus secretion, cell proliferation in gastric mucosa. Largely superseded by PPIs but the pharmacology is real. |
| Sore throat / Upper respiratory soothing | **B** | Multiple small RCTs for post-intubation sore throat (gargle form). Anti-inflammatory + demulcent effect. Traditional use well-supported for symptomatic throat relief. |
| Functional dyspepsia | **B** | GutGard (DGL preparation) — small RCTs showing symptom improvement in functional dyspepsia. |
| Hepatoprotective | **B-C** | Glycyrrhizin IV (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C — SNMC) is used in Japan for chronic hepatitis. Animal data strong. Oral licorice: limited human data. Not first-line hepatoprotective. |
| Skin lightening / Hyperpigmentation | **B-C** | Glabridin inhibits tyrosinase (melanin synthesis). Small human studies for topical use. Common in cosmetic dermatology. |
| Anti-inflammatory (systemic) | **B-C** | Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits COX-2, lipoxygenase, and complement activation. Animal and in-vitro data strong. Human systemic anti-inflammatory evidence limited. |
| Anti-viral (general) | **C** | In-vitro activity against HSV, HIV, Influenza, SARS-CoV. No clinical evidence for oral licorice as antiviral therapy. |
| Adrenal insufficiency support | **C** | Glycyrrhizin extends cortisol half-life (11β-HSD2 inhibition). Used historically for Addison's disease before synthetic corticosteroids. Not modern practice. Demonstrates the mechanism is real. |
| Medhya (Cognitive enhancement) | **C-D** | Charaka's Medhya Rasayana classification. Very limited modern cognitive data for licorice specifically. |
| Antidepressant | **C** | Animal studies (liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin). No human clinical trials. |
| Anti-cancer | **C** | In-vitro data for isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhizin. No human evidence. |
| Hormonal balancing (menopause, PCOS) | **C-D** | Weak estrogenic activity (liquiritigenin). No adequate human trials for menopause or PCOS. Over-marketed claim. |

## 4. Safe Usage Ranges (Educational Only)

> **"This is general educational information, not a medical prescription. Yashtimadhu has a well-documented dose-dependent toxicity mechanism. Do not exceed recommended ranges without practitioner supervision."**

| Form | Typical Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Root powder (Churna)** | 3-5 g/day | Traditional form. Contains 2-14% glycyrrhizin depending on source. Glycyrrhizin content usually unknown to consumer. |
| **Mulethi stick (chewing)** | 1-2 small pieces/day | Common Indian habit, especially for throat. Low dose per chew. |
| **Decoction with milk (Ksheerapaka)** | 3-5 g in milk | Classical Medhya preparation per Charaka. |
| **Standardised extract** | 250-500 mg/day | Check glycyrrhizin content on label. |
| **DGL (deglycyrrhizinated)** | 380-760 mg before meals | Safer alternative for GI use. No mineralocorticoid toxicity concern. |
| **Yashtimadhu Ghrita** | As per practitioner | Classical preparation. |

### The Critical Glycyrrhizin Dose Limit

| Daily Glycyrrhizin Intake | Risk Level |
|--------------------------|------------|
| < 50 mg/day | Low risk for most adults |
| 50-100 mg/day | Moderate risk with chronic use. Monitor BP and potassium if using >2 weeks. |
| > 100 mg/day | **High risk.** Pseudohyperaldosteronism likely with chronic use (>2 weeks). Hypertension, hypokalemia, oedema. |
| > 200 mg/day | **Dangerous.** Life-threatening complications possible. |

**Problem:** Most consumers have no idea how much glycyrrhizin they are consuming. Licorice root powder contains variable amounts (2-14% glycyrrhizin). A 5g dose of root powder could contain anywhere from 100mg to 700mg glycyrrhizin. Without standardisation, dosing is a gamble.

### Duration — This Is Non-Negotiable

- **Short-term** (1-2 weeks): Generally well-tolerated in healthy adults at standard doses.
- **Medium-term** (2-6 weeks): Monitor blood pressure and watch for oedema, headache, or muscle weakness. Potassium-rich diet recommended.
- **Long-term** (>6 weeks continuous): **NOT RECOMMENDED** without blood pressure monitoring, serum potassium testing, and practitioner supervision. This is where most toxicity cases develop.
- **DGL:** No time limit concern (glycyrrhizin removed).

## 5. Risk Coding

| Condition | Risk Code | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hypertension** | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Glycyrrhizin causes sodium retention and water retention → direct blood pressure elevation. In pre-existing hypertension, this can push BP into crisis territory. Even small glycyrrhizin doses may be clinically significant. DGL is the only acceptable form for hypertensive patients. |
| **Heart failure** | 🔴 **Avoid** | Sodium/water retention worsens volume overload in heart failure. Can precipitate acute decompensation. Contraindicated. |
| **Kidney disease** | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Impaired renal function reduces glycyrrhizin clearance → accumulation → enhanced toxicity. Electrolyte disturbance amplified. |
| **Hypokalemia or risk factors** (diuretic use, chronic diarrhoea, poor diet) | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Glycyrrhizin causes potassium wasting. Pre-existing hypokalemia + licorice = severe, potentially fatal hypokalemia (cardiac arrhythmia, muscle paralysis, respiratory compromise). |
| **On Diuretics** (especially loop/thiazide) | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Both licorice and potassium-wasting diuretics deplete potassium. Compounded hypokalemia risk. Multiple case reports of this exact combination causing hospitalisation. |
| **On Digoxin** | 🔴 **Avoid** | Hypokalemia from licorice increases digoxin toxicity (digoxin and potassium compete at the Na+/K+-ATPase). This is a potentially fatal interaction. Well-documented in pharmacology literature. |
| **On Corticosteroids** | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Glycyrrhizin inhibits cortisol metabolism → extends cortisol half-life. Combined with exogenous corticosteroids, this amplifies all glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects. Can cause Cushing-like syndrome. |
| **On Oral Contraceptives / HRT** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Estrogen + glycyrrhizin may have additive mineralocorticoid effects (estrogen itself promotes sodium retention). Also, weak estrogenic activity of liquiritigenin. |
| **Pregnancy** | 🔴 **Avoid Unless Supervised** | Finnish birth cohort studies (Raikkonen 2017) associated high maternal licorice intake (>500mg glycyrrhizin/week) with adverse child outcomes (earlier puberty, lower cognitive scores, behavioural issues). Glycyrrhizin crosses the placenta and inhibits placental 11β-HSD2, exposing the fetus to excessive maternal cortisol. **This is one of the strongest human safety signals for any herb during pregnancy.** |
| **Lactation** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Limited data. Glycyrrhizin may transfer to breast milk. Short-term low-dose traditional use likely low risk. High-dose or prolonged use: avoid. |
| **Diabetes on medication** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Glycyrrhizin's cortisol-potentiating effect may increase blood glucose (cortisol is a counter-regulatory hormone). May oppose antidiabetic medication. Paradoxical to herbs that lower glucose. |
| **Thyroid disorders** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Limited data. Some evidence of effects on thyroid hormone binding and metabolism. Monitor thyroid function. |
| **Liver disease** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Paradox: glycyrrhizin is used IV in Japan for hepatitis (SNMC), but oral licorice in patients with cirrhosis may worsen fluid retention (ascites) due to mineralocorticoid effect. Context-dependent. |
| **Hypoaldosteronism / Addison's** | 🟡–🟢 **Context-dependent** | Historically, licorice was used to supplement adrenal function in Addison's disease. The 11β-HSD2 inhibition mimics aldosterone effect. This is a rare case where the "toxicity" mechanism is therapeutically useful. Still requires medical supervision. |
| **Children** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Lower body weight = lower glycyrrhizin toxicity threshold. Traditional use of Mulethi for coughs in children is common at low doses and short duration. Avoid prolonged use or high doses. |
| **Elderly** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Higher prevalence of hypertension, heart failure, renal impairment, and diuretic use. Lower glycyrrhizin toxicity threshold. |
| **Surgery** | 🟡 **Discontinue 2 weeks before** | Electrolyte disturbance + blood pressure effects + cortisol metabolism changes. |

## 6. Side Effects

### Common (dose-dependent)
- Fluid retention / oedema (ankles, face — earliest sign of mineralocorticoid effect)
- Headache (often related to rising blood pressure)
- Increased blood pressure (may be subclinical at low doses)
- Fatigue / lethargy (potassium depletion begins before frank hypokalemia)

### Uncommon
- Muscle weakness / cramps (potassium depletion)
- Weight gain (fluid retention)
- Reduced libido / hormonal effects (anti-androgen effects documented in men; glycyrrhizin reduces testosterone via 17β-HSD and 3β-HSD modulation)
- GI discomfort

### Rare but Serious
- **Severe hypokalemia** — Muscle paralysis, respiratory compromise, rhabdomyolysis. Medical emergency. Multiple case reports.
- **Hypertensive crisis** — Blood pressure >180/120. Can cause stroke, cardiac damage. Case reports exist.
- **Cardiac arrhythmia** (particularly Torsades de Pointes) — From severe hypokalemia. Potentially fatal. Case reports in medical literature.
- **Myopathy / Rhabdomyolysis** — From profound hypokalemia. Can cause acute kidney injury.
- **Pseudoprimary hyperaldosteronism** — Full syndrome mimicking aldosterone-secreting tumour. Has led to unnecessary adrenal investigations before licorice consumption was identified.

### Testosterone Reduction in Men
Glycyrrhizic acid inhibits testosterone synthesis enzymes (17β-HSD, 3β-HSD). A clinical study (Armanini 1999) showed measurable testosterone reduction in healthy men consuming 7g licorice root daily for 7 days. Clinically significant at higher doses or chronic use. Relevant for men's reproductive health.

## 7. Drug Interactions

| Drug / Category | Risk | Mechanism |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| **Digoxin** | **CRITICAL — AVOID** | Licorice-induced hypokalemia potentiates digoxin toxicity (arrhythmia, nausea, visual disturbances). Narrow therapeutic index drug. Case reports of fatal interactions. |
| **Loop diuretics** (Furosemide) | **High** | Both cause potassium wasting. Compounded hypokalemia risk. Case reports of hospitalisation. |
| **Thiazide diuretics** (Hydrochlorothiazide) | **High** | Same mechanism as loop diuretics. Compounded potassium loss. |
| **Potassium-sparing diuretics** (Spironolactone) | **Moderate** (pharmacological opposition) | Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. Glycyrrhizin mimics aldosterone. They oppose each other. Licorice may reduce spironolactone's efficacy. |
| **Corticosteroids** (Prednisolone, Dexamethasone) | **High** | Glycyrrhizin extends cortisol half-life by inhibiting its metabolism. Amplifies all corticosteroid effects — hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, osteoporosis, fluid retention. |
| **Antihypertensives** (all classes) | **Moderate-High** | Licorice directly raises blood pressure, opposing antihypertensive therapy. May cause treatment "failure" — physician increases drug dose without knowing licorice is the cause. |
| **Anticoagulants** (Warfarin) | **Low-Moderate** | Some evidence of CYP interaction. Monitor INR. |
| **Antidiabetic drugs** | **Moderate** | Cortisol potentiation raises blood glucose. Opposes antidiabetic medication. |
| **SSRIs** | **Low-Moderate** | Liquiritin has serotonergic properties in animal models. Theoretical additive. Clinical significance unknown. |
| **Oral contraceptives / HRT** | **Moderate** | Additive mineralocorticoid effects (both promote sodium retention). Increased fluid retention and BP risk. |
| **QT-prolonging drugs** (Amiodarone, certain antibiotics, antipsychotics) | **High** | Licorice-induced hypokalemia + QT-prolonging drug = Torsades de Pointes risk. Potentially fatal. |
| **Laxatives (stimulant type)** | **Moderate** | Chronic laxative use depletes potassium. Combined with licorice = compounded hypokalemia. |
| **MAO inhibitors** | **Low-Moderate (theoretical)** | Some licorice compounds have MAO-inhibitory activity in-vitro. Clinical significance uncertain. |

## 8. Misuse Patterns in India

### Pattern 1: Chronic Mulethi Chewing
Common habit, especially in North India and among vocalists/teachers (for throat). A few sticks daily is likely low-risk. But habitual heavy chewing (5-10+ sticks daily, chronic) can deliver significant glycyrrhizin doses. Users rarely associate their rising blood pressure or ankle swelling with their "harmless" Mulethi habit. Several "mystery hypertension" cases in Indian cardiology literature resolved when the patient stopped chronic Mulethi use.

### Pattern 2: Kadha Overuse with Mulethi
Mulethi is a standard ingredient in COVID-era Kadha recipes and winter decoctions. When combined with daily Kadha habit (2-3 cups), Tulsi tea, and other herbal preparations, cumulative glycyrrhizin intake may exceed safe limits. Users track none of this.

### Pattern 3: "It's Just a Sweet Herb"
Mulethi's pleasant sweet taste creates a false sense of safety. Unlike bitter herbs (Guduchi, Neem) where the taste itself signals caution, Mulethi tastes benign. This palatability encourages overconsumption, especially in children's formulations where sweetness is preferred.

### Pattern 4: Undisclosed Use to Physicians
Patients rarely mention Mulethi consumption to their cardiologist or endocrinologist. When blood pressure rises or potassium drops, the physician investigates pathological causes (renal artery stenosis, Conn's syndrome, adrenal tumours) without knowing that the answer is sitting in the patient's kitchen. This leads to unnecessary — and expensive — investigations.

### Pattern 5: Combined With Diuretics
Elderly patients on Furosemide or Hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure or heart failure who simultaneously consume Mulethi in Kadha or as a throat soother. This combination has caused hospitalisations for hypokalemia. Neither the physician (who doesn't ask about herbs) nor the patient (who doesn't think Mulethi is "medicine") connects the dots.

## 9. When to See a Doctor

- **Rising blood pressure** (even mildly) coinciding with Mulethi use — get BP checked, inform physician about Mulethi consumption
- **Ankle or facial swelling / unexplained weight gain** — fluid retention may indicate mineralocorticoid effect. Stop Mulethi. Get electrolytes checked.
- **Muscle weakness, cramps, or unusual fatigue** — may indicate potassium depletion. Request serum potassium. Stop Mulethi.
- **Palpitations or irregular heartbeat** — hypokalemia-induced arrhythmia. URGENT. Seek immediate care.
- **Headache + swelling + visual disturbance** — possible hypertensive crisis. URGENT.
- **Dark urine, muscle pain** — possible rhabdomyolysis from severe hypokalemia. URGENT. Seek emergency care.
- **Any unexplained electrolyte abnormality** — always disclose herbal use, including Mulethi, to your treating physician
- **Pregnancy planning or confirmed pregnancy** — discontinue Mulethi. Finnish birth cohort data suggests adverse fetal effects at high glycyrrhizin exposure.

**Critical reminder:** When visiting a doctor for hypertension, oedema, hypokalemia, or cardiac symptoms — **always mention Mulethi/licorice consumption.** Undisclosed use is one of the most common causes of "unexplained" hypokalemia in Indian clinical practice.
