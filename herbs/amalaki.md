**Common Names:** Amla, Indian Gooseberry, Nellikai (Tamil/Kannada), Usirikaya (Telugu), Aonla (Hindi market name)
**Botanical:** *Phyllanthus emblica* L. (syn. *Emblica officinalis* Gaertn.)
**Family:** Phyllanthaceae (formerly Euphorbiaceae)
**Part Used:** Fruit (primary — both fresh and dried), seed (limited), bark (traditional, uncommon), leaves (limited)
**Habitat:** Deciduous tree found across tropical and subtropical India. Both wild and extensively cultivated. Grows from plains to 1800m elevation.

**Note:** Amalaki is one of the three components of Triphala (covered in a separate entry). This entry addresses Amalaki as a standalone herb with its own distinct clinical profile.

## 1. Overview

Amalaki (Amla) occupies a unique position: it is simultaneously a common kitchen fruit (Amla murabba, Amla achaar, Amla juice — consumed by millions daily), one of Ayurveda's supreme Rasayanas, and a pharmacologically significant source of bioavailable Vitamin C and tannins. It is also one of the few Ayurvedic herbs where the traditional claims and modern evidence are in relatively close alignment.

### Classical References

- **Charaka Samhita** — Amalaki is the single most referenced Rasayana fruit. Charaka states: "Of all the Rasayanas, Amalaki Rasayana is considered the best." Classified under **Vayahsthapana** (age-maintaining — #1 herb), **Jvarahara** (anti-pyretic), **Kasahara** (anti-tussive), and multiple other categories. The famous Chyawanprash formulation is Amalaki-based.
- **Sushruta Samhita** — Referenced for Raktapitta (bleeding disorders), Prameha (diabetes), and as a base for multiple formulations.
- **Ashtanga Hridaya** — Described as Tridoshahara, with particular emphasis on Pitta pacification.
- **Bhavaprakasha Nighantu** — Extensive monograph. Calls it the foremost among Vayahsthapana herbs.

### Rasayana Classification
Amalaki is classified as a **primary Rasayana** — the highest tier. It is the base of Chyawanprash (the most consumed Rasayana formulation in India), Dhatri Rasayana, Amalaki Rasayana, and Brahma Rasayana. Its Rasayana status is more extensively documented in classical texts than any other single herb.

### Traditional Indications
- Vayahsthapana (Anti-aging — primary Rasayana)
- Raktapitta (Bleeding disorders — Sheeta virya + Madhura + Kashaya stanch bleeding)
- Prameha / Madhumeha (Diabetes/metabolic disorders)
- Amlapitta (Hyperacidity — despite being Amla/sour, it is Pitta-pacifying)
- Pandu (Anaemia — Vitamin C enhances iron absorption)
- Jwara (Fever)
- Daha (Burning sensation)
- Netra Roga (Eye conditions — part of Triphala Ghrita)
- Keshya (Hair health — Amla oil, Amla in hair formulations)
- Medhya (Cognitive support — as part of Rasayana formulations)

### The Vitamin C Question
Amla is celebrated as "the richest natural source of Vitamin C." This is approximately true — fresh Amla contains 600-900mg Vitamin C per 100g fruit (compared to 50-80mg in oranges). However, the situation is more nuanced than marketing suggests, and is addressed in Section 3.

## 2. Ayurvedic Perspective

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Rasa** (Taste) | Pancharasa — all five tastes present, with **Amla** (Sour) and **Madhura** (Sweet) predominant. Also Kashaya (Astringent), Tikta (Bitter), and Katu (Pungent — subtle) |
| **Guna** (Qualities) | Laghu (Light), Ruksha (Dry), Sheeta (Cool) |
| **Virya** (Potency) | Sheeta (Cooling) |
| **Vipaka** (Post-digestive effect) | Madhura (Sweet) |

### Dosha Action
- **Pitta:** Strongly pacifies. Sheeta virya + Madhura vipaka + the cooling nature of all five rasas in Amalaki make it one of Ayurveda's most effective Pitta-pacifying herbs. The sour taste (Amla rasa), which would normally aggravate Pitta, is overridden by Sheeta virya and Madhura vipaka in this case — a classical exception noted specifically for Amalaki.
- **Vata:** Pacifies. Madhura vipaka + Amla rasa (sour is Vata-reducing) counterbalance the Ruksha and Laghu gunas.
- **Kapha:** Mildly pacifies (Kashaya rasa + Ruksha + Laghu reduce Kapha). But will not aggravate significantly even in Kapha types due to balanced profile.

**Tridoshahara but Pitta-primary:** Amalaki is among the few genuinely Tridoshahara herbs, but its strength is unmistakably in Pitta pacification. It is the first herb considered for any Pitta-aggravated condition requiring Rasayana.

### The Sour-but-Cooling Paradox
Students of Ayurveda often ask: "How can a sour fruit be cooling?" In standard Ayurvedic pharmacology, Amla rasa (sour taste) is Ushna (heating). Amalaki is the classical exception. Its Sheeta virya dominates its Amla rasa, and its Madhura vipaka ensures a sweet post-digestive effect. This is specifically noted in multiple Nighantus as a unique property (Prabhava) of Amalaki.

## 3. Modern Pharmacology

### Key Compounds

- **Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)** — 600-900 mg per 100g fresh fruit. Notably, Amla's Vitamin C is unusually heat-stable due to complexation with tannins (gallic acid, ellagic acid), which protect it from oxidative degradation during cooking and processing. This is pharmacologically significant — dried Amla retains more Vitamin C than expected.
- **Emblicanin A and B** — Hydrolysable tannins unique to Amla. Among the most potent natural antioxidants characterised. ORAC values exceed most known food antioxidants.
- **Gallic acid** — Hydrolysable tannin. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chelation properties.
- **Ellagic acid** — Polyphenol. Anti-proliferative, antioxidant.
- **Phyllemblin** — Tannin-related compound. Antioxidant.
- **Quercetin** — Flavonoid. Anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic.
- **Chebulic acid** — Also found in Haritaki. Cross-constituent in Triphala.
- **Pectin** — Soluble fibre. Prebiotic, cholesterol-binding.
- **Iron, Calcium, Phosphorus, Chromium** — Mineral content. Iron + Vitamin C co-presence = enhanced iron bioavailability.

### The Vitamin C Reality Check

**The claim:** "Amla has 20x more Vitamin C than orange."

**The reality, with nuance:**
- Fresh Amla: ~600-900mg/100g Vitamin C. This IS exceptionally high.
- But: Most Indians consume Amla as murabba (sugar-preserved, cooked — Vitamin C partially lost), achaar (pickled — variable retention), dried powder (40-60% retention), or juice (commercial — variable).
- The 20x figure applies to fresh fruit. Processed forms have lower content.
- Additionally: Much of Amla's antioxidant activity comes from tannins (Emblicanin A, B, gallic acid), not just Vitamin C. Studies comparing Amla antioxidant activity with and without Vitamin C show that tannins contribute 50-70% of total antioxidant capacity.
- **Implication:** Amla's health effects cannot be reduced to its Vitamin C content alone. It is a synergistic matrix of Vitamin C + tannins + polyphenols. Taking a Vitamin C pill is not equivalent to consuming Amla.

### Evidence Table

| Claim | Evidence Level | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Antioxidant activity | **A** | Extensive data. Emblicanin A/B among most potent natural antioxidants. In-vivo and in-vitro. Reduced oxidative stress markers in multiple human studies. |
| Dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids) | **B** | Multiple small RCTs show LDL reduction, HDL increase, and triglyceride reduction. Consistent direction. Effect size comparable to dietary interventions, not statins. Amla 500mg-1g/day in most trials. |
| Blood sugar regulation (type 2 diabetes) | **B** | Small RCTs show fasting glucose and HbA1c reduction. Chromium content + polyphenol-mediated insulin sensitisation. Adjunct to medication, not replacement. |
| Anti-inflammatory (CRP reduction) | **B** | Small human studies show CRP and IL-6 reduction. Mechanism: NF-kB inhibition, COX-2 modulation. |
| Iron absorption enhancement | **B** | Vitamin C + iron co-administration is well-established pharmacology. Amla enhances non-heme iron absorption. Used in anaemia management (Dhatri Loha formulation). |
| Gastric protection | **B-C** | Animal studies robust (reduced gastric acid, cytoprotective mucus enhancement). Small human trials for functional dyspepsia. |
| Hepatoprotective | **C** | Animal studies positive (CCl4, alcohol models). Limited human data. |
| Anti-cancer | **C** | In-vitro anti-proliferative effects (gallic acid, ellagic acid). No human trials. Not a cancer treatment. |
| Hair growth / Hair health | **C-D** | Primarily traditional + cosmetic use. Amla oil is ubiquitous in India. Some in-vitro data on hair follicle stimulation. No clinical trials for hair growth. |
| Anti-aging / Longevity | **D** | Classical Rasayana claim. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile provides biological plausibility. No human longevity studies. |
| Cognitive enhancement | **C-D** | Part of Chyawanprash Rasayana tradition. Very limited standalone cognitive data. |
| Eye health | **C-D** | Part of Triphala Ghrita tradition for eye conditions. Antioxidant rationale. No standalone RCTs. |

## 4. Safe Usage Ranges (Educational Only)

> **"This is general educational information, not a medical prescription."**

| Form | Typical Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Fresh fruit** | 1-2 fruits/day | Traditional consumption. Sour taste. Best eaten fresh or as juice. |
| **Amla juice (fresh)** | 20-30 ml/day | Diluted with water. Commercial Amla juices vary in concentration and additives. |
| **Dried powder (Churna)** | 3-6 g/day | Standard medicinal form. With honey and water, or in milk. |
| **Standardised extract** | 500-1000 mg/day | Commercial preparations. Standardisation varies. |
| **Amla Murabba** | 1-2 pieces/day | Traditional preserved form. High sugar content — diabetics should be cautious. The sugar content may negate blood sugar benefits. |
| **Chyawanprash** | 1-2 teaspoons/day | Amla-based polyherbal Rasayana. Contains 40+ herbs, ghee, sesame oil, sugar/honey. Not pure Amla. |
| **Amla oil (topical)** | As needed | For hair and scalp. Not for ingestion. Most commercial "Amla oils" contain mineral oil base with Amla extract — not pure Amla oil. |

### Duration
- Dietary Amla consumption: Lifelong. Safe. Part of Indian food culture.
- Supplement/churna use: Well-tolerated long-term. Periodic review reasonable.
- Chyawanprash: Traditional seasonal use (winter/Hemanta-Shishira). Year-round use is common modern practice.

## 5. Risk Coding

| Condition | Risk Code | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Pregnancy** | 🟢 **Generally Safe** | Dietary Amla: safe. Long history of use in pregnancy. Vitamin C + iron support is beneficial. Chyawanprash during pregnancy: traditionally recommended. High-dose concentrated extracts: insufficient data, use moderately. |
| **Lactation** | 🟢 **Generally Safe** | Dietary use and standard churna. No concerns at normal doses. |
| **Diabetes on medication** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Blood sugar lowering demonstrated. Additive with antidiabetic drugs. Monitor glucose. Amla Murabba's sugar content paradoxically raises glucose — avoid in diabetics. |
| **Bleeding disorders / Blood thinners** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Vitamin C in high doses may interact with Warfarin (conflicting data — may increase or decrease INR). Monitor if on anticoagulants. |
| **Iron overload (Hemochromatosis)** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Vitamin C dramatically enhances iron absorption. In iron overload conditions, this is harmful. Avoid high-dose Amla if iron levels are elevated. |
| **Kidney stones (oxalate type)** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | High Vitamin C intake can increase urinary oxalate in some individuals. Amla also contains oxalates directly. Relevant for recurrent calcium oxalate stone formers. |
| **GERD / Hyperacidity** | 🟢–🟡 | Paradox: Amla is sour (Amla rasa) but traditionally used for Amlapitta (hyperacidity). Many patients tolerate it well due to Sheeta virya. Some individuals find the sourness aggravates reflux. Individual response varies. Start cautiously. |
| **Children** | 🟢 **Generally Safe** | Chyawanprash is routinely given to children (reduced dose: 1/2-1 tsp). Amla juice diluted is safe. Traditional paediatric use is extensive. |
| **Scheduled surgery** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Vitamin C effects on bleeding + iron absorption may complicate surgical planning. Discontinue high-dose supplements 1-2 weeks before. Dietary Amla: no concern. |
| **Kidney disease** | 🟡 **Use With Caution** | Oxalate load + enhanced mineral absorption. Potassium content in fresh Amla may be relevant in advanced CKD. Consult nephrologist for regular supplemental use. |

## 6. Side Effects

### Common
- Sour taste may cause mild GI discomfort in sensitive individuals
- Increased urination (mild diuretic effect)
- Mild blood sugar drop (subclinical in non-diabetics)

### Uncommon
- Acid reflux aggravation (individual — despite traditional anti-acid use)
- Diarrhea at higher doses (tannin + fibre content)
- Constipation (astringent tannin effect in some individuals — opposite response)
- Dry skin with chronic high-dose dried form (Ruksha guna)

### Rare
- Allergic reaction (very rare with Amla)
- Kidney stone exacerbation (high-dose, predisposed individuals)
- Iron overload aggravation (Hemochromatosis patients)

## 7. Drug Interactions

| Drug / Category | Risk | Mechanism |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| **Antidiabetic drugs** | **Moderate** | Additive blood sugar lowering. Monitor glucose. |
| **Anticoagulants** (Warfarin) | **Low-Moderate** | Vitamin C may affect Warfarin metabolism (conflicting data). Monitor INR. |
| **Iron supplements** | **Beneficial interaction** | Vitamin C enhances non-heme iron absorption 2-6x. Take together for anaemia benefit. Avoid in iron overload. |
| **Antihypertensives** | **Low** | Minimal data on blood pressure effects. Unlikely significant. |
| **Statins** | **Low** | Mild additive lipid-lowering. Not clinically significant. |
| **Aluminium-containing antacids** | **Low-Moderate** | Vitamin C increases aluminium absorption from antacids. Avoid concurrent use if on chronic antacid therapy. |
| **Tannin-sensitive drugs** (iron, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) | **Moderate** | Tannins chelate certain drugs. Separate by 2 hours. Note: Iron interaction is beneficial, but other chelated drugs lose efficacy. |

## 8. Misuse Patterns in India

### Pattern 1: Amla Murabba as "Healthy" Despite Sugar Content
Amla murabba contains massive amounts of sugar (60-70% sugar syrup). It is consumed as a "health food" by diabetics and weight-conscious individuals. The Vitamin C and polyphenol content does not offset the glycaemic impact of that much sugar. A fresh Amla or diluted juice provides the benefits without the sugar load.

### Pattern 2: "Vitamin C Megadosing" With Amla
Some consumers take multiple Amla supplements + fresh juice + Chyawanprash daily, believing more Vitamin C = more immunity. The body's Vitamin C absorption plateaus at ~200-400mg/day — beyond this, excess is excreted renally. Megadosing increases oxalate formation risk without proportional benefit.

### Pattern 3: Commercial Amla Juice Quality Issues
Bottled "Amla juice" products in India vary enormously in actual Amla content, preservative use, dilution, and sugar addition. Some products are more water and preservative than Amla. Reading labels is essential.

### Pattern 4: Amla Oil Expectations
Most commercial "Amla hair oils" are mineral oil or coconut oil base with Amla extract or fragrance. The actual Amla content is often negligible. True Amla-infused oil (prepared by boiling Amla in sesame or coconut oil) is different from commercial products. Consumer expectations often exceed product reality.

## 9. When to See a Doctor

- **Recurrent kidney stone symptoms** (flank pain, blood in urine) — especially if consuming high-dose Amla + oxalate-rich diet
- **Symptoms of iron overload** (fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, skin darkening) — relevant if taking Amla with iron supplements chronically
- **Persistent acid reflux** worsening with Amla use
- **Blood sugar fluctuations** on antidiabetic medication after starting Amla supplements
- **Unusual bleeding** if on anticoagulants
- **Any allergic reaction** — rare but possible
